  "title": "DISEC: A Skirmish Against Cyber Arms Trade",
  "content": "*When tyranny enters a nation, it is wrapped in the land’s cloth, carrying illicit arms in one hand in one hand and bashing minorities with the other*. Over the past hour, DISEC delegates have both grappled with the issue of the illicit arms trade on the dark web, and discussed issues and potential solutions. \n\nAs of the debate’s first hours, all delegations have been echoing the voice of Denmark and the US, who seek the removal of dark web media through a battle against cryptocurrency using the database and tools available to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). Debate has remained intense, arguing methods shipment of arms, with nations such as Iran and Israel agreeing upon the need for stronger border security.\n\nEven though all nations unanimously agree to key issues, each nation has sought a separate path forward, with the delegation of New Zealand questioning the attack on cryptocurrency by quoting personal sovereignty. In response, the representative of Iran pressed the need for a repeal to the current dark web basis on anonymity laws, stating in **an exclusive interview** with Al Jazeera that anonymity “a privilege, not a right” that could be repealed if exploited, a statement echoed by the rest of the committee.  \n\nAs the debate begins to heat up, the committee has polarized into two unique blocks respective to their national interest. On one side, delegations from nations like the US and South Korea have grouped around the critical importance of tackling the issues of crypto, while on the other hand, delegates such as Russia, Iran, and New Zealand have been supporting each nation’s proposal. \n\nIn an interview with Iran’s vocal delegate, Iran disagreed with the issues of personal sovereignty raised by the US and believed that the US would be an issue moving forward. As the debate continues, a question still stands, will the discussion in the coming weekends help tackle the issues of the arms trade, or will it be another bust? \n",

  "title": "Roaring Debates Take Place Inside the United States Senate  on Long-Awaited Adjustments to Affordable Healthcare ",
  "content": "*New York Times, April 2021*\n\nAs senators from all around the United States battle out their opinions on the failed doings of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the demand for change rises. While affordable healthcare has been debated over the span of decades, the Senate notes minimal legislative progress. While the Republican senators believe the ACA has benefited the American population, Democratic senators, such as Bernie Sanders, tend to disagree.  \n\nSanders has stated his belief that the government should stop spending time on failed projects, such as the ACA, but rather focus on helping the current situation at hand with new ideas. Fellow democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, has expressed that applying tax to health insurance would increase the number of people using it by creating competition between companies. Although both parties have many different views, both sides believe the government is in a very good position of influencing people's decisions about their healthcare plans. The people trust their government, therefore the government's responsibility is to address healthcare in an appropriate manner.\n\nOn the other hand, Senators have debated the implications of both the public and private health insurance systems. Senator of Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse, likes the idea of further developing the public health care system due to its low cost and no deductibles. Ultimately the democratic Senators have continuously been voicing how an American citizen shouldn’t be choosing between having a decent healthcare system or putting food on the table. It has also been voiced how transparency to the citizens has been wanted for many years. Overall, people are angry and many do not have the luxury of healthcare. \n\nAs the flaming debates continue, the American people keep waiting. Although there are no doubts that the senators are trying to work together to solve this issue and develop more affordable healthcare plans, time is running out. \n",

  "title": "Asylum Policy in Europe",
  "content": "Throughout this EU session, country delegates discuss the current asylum policy. Frontline nations such as Italy, Spain and Greece are feeling immense stress from the sheer amount of refugees entering their countries. These amicable nations are asking the EU for help with redirecting refugees in need to other nations better equipped to help. The strain of resources and money paired with the COVID-19 pandemic is often too much for these countries to deal with. Multiple other countries are offering their help through funding camps and transportation routes, although there is disagreement around focuses on either short-term transportation against long-term solutions such as relocation of camps. \n\nGermany is speaking on this topic, calling out financial problems as well as promoting the idea of camp relocations to countries who are able to maintain the best quality of life for refugees. However other countries such as Poland are attempting to bring the EU together and to redirect focus onto short-term solutions that can be attained in a timely manner. At the center of this discussion is the debate on whether improving the current refugee camps will ultimately be more effective than moving refugee camps as a whole. The Netherlands alongside Portugal are speaking on the effectiveness of these proposed short-term solutions and are pitted against Germany at the moment. France is asking for a compromise on this situation, focusing on both short and long-term solutions, making the solid point that refugees in current times would potentially be harmed by the decision to solely focus on the long-term. \n\nThe important topic of COVID-19 is also brought to light. As the world has been ravaged by the virus, the impacts on the lives of refugees has been immense. Because of the severity of the situation, frontline countries have doubts about accepting more refugees while worrying about the safety of their citizens. COVID-19 is making this conclusion all the more difficult for the EU to come to a unanimous solution as countries are concerned for the well-being of themselves and their fellow EU members. On this topic Germany comments on how countries may not have \"enough to spare\" on COVID-19 supplies and specialists. All countries who are affected by the pandemic are partial to these concerns, although no solid compromise have been reached at the moment of publication. Euronews appreciates the focus on this particular issue as we recognize the difficulties felt by the world in these difficult times. \n\nAs the session comes to a suspenseful close, countries continue to debate on the impacts of both options. The EU appears to be struggling to reach a conclusion that will be in the best interests of all countries at the moment. It is the hope of Euronews that these beneficent nations are able to reach a state of cooperation and are able to combine their want to improve the lives of refugees in need in order to bring forth a solution.

  "title": "WHO discusses impacts of air pollution on chronic respiratory diseases",
  "content": "(CNN) – Upon settling on the topic of prevention of chronic respiratory diseases, the WHO delegates launched into a focused discussion of preventing CRDs in lower income countries. \n\nThe solutions proposed by the delegates are many: disease prevention systems, investment and financial aid lower income nations, research, and as Haiti bravely pioneered, the implementation of different gas systems in homes. The United States cited the matter as a “deeply ingrained issue that [must be] discuss[ed] now”, and diplomatically praises those speeches made by fellow member nations, but crucially proposes the “development of individual countries’ healthcare systems” to avoid dependence in consideration of the future and long term solutions.\n\nThe fruitful discussion became oddly interrupted by confusion over raised hands calling for a revote, and as hands often symbolize hospitality and generosity, wonderfully tying in with the lovely notions of member nations to mutually aid, develop and progress as a whole. The issue quickly passed, and once again the nations continued.\n\nTransitioning into the discussion of public awareness surrounding CRDs, expectedly the nations of the committee seem to be in consensus to improve facilities that promote public education, and pointed out many contributing factors to CRDs. A number of delegates seem keen on discussing tobacco and cigarette usage, and have consistently proposed moderated caucuses, as of the moment without success in gaining a majority to enter a focused discussion on the matter.\n\nThe dais encouraged delegates to look beyond a narrow scope and gauge the bigger picture. Perhaps more explicitly, other member nations have pointedly remarked in response that air pollution affects developing nations far more than that of tobacco and cigarette usage. Air pollution and smoking go hand in hand in terms of health risks, pointed out in the course of debate, and the smooth integration of the topics in a diplomatic, amiable fashion provided a satisfactory end for WHO’s first committee session. \n\n",

  "title": "Traumatisation, Deception, and Abduction  - Tackling the Rise of Women in Terrorist Organisations",
  "content": "The economy is the backbone of any nation; social prosperity ensues. With illusory promises of a better economic and social status, women are forced down the path of violence and terror, seeing it as the only source of viable money. In regions, notably the Middle East, the roles of women are confined by ‘traditional’ values. Women often are restrained from receiving education, pressing them to choose terrorism as a method of income as they see no other path. As a result, they are unable to determine the true nature of these organisations and make decisions free of external influence. Furthermore, women are also subject to oppression within the household, carrying out domestic duties and serving their husbands. Hence, international efforts to eradicate terrorism failed to notice their utilisation, leading to approximately 10 per cent of recruits to the Islamic State being women. Nonetheless, their recruitment as suicide bombings and logistical operatives is still on the rise. Regardless of logistical roles in these terrorist organisations, women are subject to living horrors, notably sexual assault, forced marriage and childbirth, and even their selling to raise funds for further terrorist operations. \n\n\nNot only is the recruitment of women prevalent domestically, but terrorist organisations expand overseas to fulfil their international operations. Recently, numerous notorious female terrorists are native to Europe, choosing to flee their home countries to join Middle Eastern organisations. Nearly 550 women joined ISIS from Europe, and a further 60 joined the Al-Khansaa brigade. Several terrorist organisations use social media to spread their propaganda to Europe, spreading their radical ideology. It is well noted that every coin has two sides. Thus, despite the European Union’s efforts regulatory efforts, the right to privacy has hindered the EU’s actions to crack down on online terrorist recruitment.\n\n\nAs noted by Rwanda, creating domestic business incentives for women is a viable solution to fix the economic status of women in impoverished nations, which, in turn, lifts them from social poverty. Creating initiatives to promote cultural artisan crafts like knitting, weaving, and soap production will prove effective in the long run.\n\n\nRegardless, China is proud to have significantly decrease domestic terrorism regardless of gender. In historically separatist regions like Xinjiang, terrorism has virtually been eradicated for the past 20 years. Through government initiatives to promote skills and language education, potential separatists have found better alternatives to chaos. These efforts have led to increased GDP growth in the region as well.",

  "title": "The IAC \"Debates\" (Without Clash) Indigenous Communities in Canada's Criminal Justice System",
  "content": "\n    \n   As we enter the first committee session in the Indigenous Advisory Committee, both the Dais and the delegates learn to work with a digital platform. Not once does the Chair forget to say “virtual hands” when asking delegates for points or motion. He hits his gavel to give the customary 10-second warning, and takes a moment to ask delegates if they can hear his gavel, just to confirm. \n\nHeading into the primary speaker's list, the two for two against, and secondary speakers list, delegates make speeches. The speeches were impressive indeed, so much so that we’re suspecting some of these delegates wrote these speeches beforehand; we’re sure this committee is full of knowledgeable and eloquent delegates, but does eloquence bring this many statistics, dates and references per speech? Regardless, the content and speeches in this committee have been impressive and informative.  \n\nThe IAC decides to discuss the topic of indigenous communities in Canada's criminal justice system first. Delegates first bring up issues with the status quo of the Indigenous communities and the justice system’s interaction. They bring up valid issues of overrepresentation in justice systems and police brutality. Nuances such as intergenerational trauma and colonial influences are acknowledged, and solutions such as restorative justice, and especially legal independence begin to be discussed. Delegates begin to develop their ideas regarding solutions, and discussing details and mechanisms of their solutions. We hear of plans to consult different first nations for restorative justice, and what legal independence would look like. In fact, delegates are in such agreement with each other that we have seen absolutely zero conflict or disagreement. The phrase “I echo the sentiments of the delegate before me” and “I agree with the previous points” are now customary at the beginning of every speech. \n\nAs the first committee session comes to a close, delegates are immersed in discussing and developing their solutions, we wish them luck in their next sessions! \n\n\n\n",

  "title": "Members of SOCHUM Discuss and Try to Combat Child Labor ",
  "content": "Members of SOCHUM try urgently to combat child labour in developing countries even though it is only the first committee session. The delegates are already coming up with innovative solutions to combat child labour.\n\nIn this session, it seems that SOCHUM has voted to discuss Topic A (Child Labour in Developing Countries). Countries like the United States are already willing to work with other countries to end the horrible practise of child slavery in their countries.\n\nYet, before the delegates can develop more solutions, they must realise the root causes of child labour. In a moderated caucus on Root Causes of Child Labour, South Africa has stated that the leading cause of child labour is simple. Poor education and poor condition, forcing children to work instead of getting an education. Yet, Finland, one of the major contributors to countering child labour, believes that the leading cause is that since these kids have no money or education, the factories are abusing this and making the children work for money. It is evident that these two views are quite similar, so we hope that countries in SOCHUM will be able to corporate together.\n\nIn another moderated caucus on the Reintegration of Children in Society, the generous United Kingdom has stated that the best way to reintegrate children into society, these developing countries should make programmes. The United Kingdom has also stated they are willing to help fund these programmes as in the end, “children will be and are the future.”\n\nThe dais has constantly tried to get those countries that have spoken less to express their ideas and solutions. The committee members are already saying their solutions and communicating with other countries they agree with and are willing to work together with.\n\nThe members of SOCHUM seem confident in their ability to combat child labour and are not hesitant in expressing their ideas. Members have already come up with solutions such as creating a better education system and promoting specific organisations to help fund essential infrastructure. The passion the delegates have in this conference will enable the combat against child labour in the future.\n",

  "title": "America Takes Lead in Denouncing Chinese Financial Exploitation",
  "content": "In an energetic start to the conference, many of the delegates of NATO found common ground on their stances against China’s exploitation of smaller nations. In fighting for worldwide economic justice, the American delegate brought forth recent demonstrations of Chinese immorality such as their false claims to the Philippines’ Whitsun Reef and the Iran-China deal, both of which grant China access to strategic sects of the globe. Delegates were quick to join America’s bloc, occasionally offering their own histories with Chinese debt-trapping and investment. The delegate of the United States emerged as a leader of this bloc, warning other delegates of the nation’s devious intentions and aggressive actions.\n\nHowever, a few delegates remained skeptical of these attacks on Xi’s regime. In one particularly heated caucus, the delegate of Montenegro sympathized with the Chinese government, accusing the Sri Lankan government of being “corrupt” and “irresponsible” despite them accumulating crippling amounts of debt from unwanted Chinese infrastructure projects. The American delegate refuted this narrative, reminding the committee to not conflate a nation’s poor financial situation with corruption—to not conflate unjust circumstances with a lack of ethics.\n\nThe German delegate elaborated on America’s defense of smaller nations, suggesting that the root cause of malicious Chinese expansionism is the lack of consequences they face for crimes—events such as the Uyghur genocide were brought forth by others in response to this bold idea. Furthermore, Germany suggests that NATO establishes command centers to unify and expedite NATO’s decisions surrounding the protection of smaller nations from Chinese exploitation. As the first committee session ended, ally nations expressed their support for this popular idea. The future of the fight against China’s hostile schemes looks bright for the committee.\n",

  "title": "ASEAN Grapples With Rising Sea Levels ",
  "content": "Out of the ten recognized Southeastern Asian nations, none have yet made tangible progress on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Designed to mandate progress on seventeen climate action measures, the goals’ 2030 deadline looms over the sinking region. Let no mistake be made: panic has set in. Scientists have projected that by 2050, hundreds of coastal cities will be lost and millions of people are at risk of imminent destruction. With the majority of these communities being located in developing countries, this issue disproportionately affects Southeast Asian nations, which are also characterized as being low to the ocean and prone to natural disasters such as tsunamis, typhoons, and flash flooding.\n\nAt today’s session of the Canadian High Schools Model United Nations (CAHSMUN) conference, delegates from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore urged each other to take dynamic action. Alarmed by the impending submersion of South Asian trade capitals Bangkok, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Manila, each nation proposed a plethora of equally pragmatic actions to be taken by the others. Unfortunately, the three nations all failed to acknowledge the elephant in the room: who will offer their resources to help their cause?  \n\nJust as most United Nations (UN) detractors often stress, the body has never struggled to suggest a wide array of feasible and economically considerate approaches; nay, the UN’s shortcomings are not due to its resolutions but rather to its members. It is time for these enthusiastic nations to take a page from the book of an average toddler and learn to not bite off more than they can chew. \n\nIn the western hemisphere, us Canadians are not exempt from this crisis. Eminent climate researchers predict that Metro Vancouver will closely resemble the ancient city of Atlantis if dynamic remedial action is not taken by 2030. While Canada ranks thirteenth in the world by measure of SDG progress, we still fall drastically behind where we need to be. For the sake of millions of coastal Canadians, we have a long way to go.\n\nThe CAHSMUN conference will resume this discussion on Saturday and Sunday. At The Globe and Mail, we are eager to report on the resolutions made to combat this environmental, social, and economic crisis, and will update readers as soon as we can. \n",

  "title": "Rehabilitation versus Punishment: ILO on Prison Labor (Opinion Piece Included)",
  "content": "(CNN) – Ethics and morality regarding prisoner labor remains an ambiguous matter, the line between reformation and cruelty often blurring within complex prison systems. \n\nAmid discussion Finland provided an excellent point: “the purpose of prison is to prevent crime”, which should remain at the forefront of the mind whilst discussing the matter. The United States stresses the positives of prison labor, citing that prisoners who voluntarily participate have much to gain from the experience. The congregation seemingly is in agreeance to retain aspects of the prison labor system, with improvements. With this development, delegates enter a focused discussion regarding minimum wage for prison labor, the definition of fair compensation in such scenarios sparking speeches mirroring contrasting viewpoints whether prisoners should receive the same minimum wage as non incarcerated individuals or less than that value.\n\n(Opinion) - The criminal justice system exists to punish transgressions and strives for general improvement of society, and those convicted of criminal charges face lifelong obstacles in regards to employment, which severely impacts economic growth in countries with a high percentage of the population having criminal records. In regards to minimum wage in prisons, setting such a standard across the international community would be an enormously strenuous operation with many factors being unpredictable and not under the jurisdiction of the organization. \n\nCurrency values differ by country, and naturally, the differences in prison structure and management exist not only across nations but also internally, an example being private prison establishments, and these institutions have different interactions with government as opposed to federal prison institutions. While the encouragement and recommendation from the ILO to government systems, prison structures and the general public of wages in prison labor being around a certain value is plausible, without a means to enforce such regulations on an international scale, such notions may prove too idealistic to prevail long-term. The successes of the committee will solely depend on the willingness of delegates to compromise, implement and hold true the agreements made by the whole.\n",

This point drove the need for legislation for such management to the top of the agenda, as delegates echoed the all too common financial need sentiment. To add to the debate, a key point was brought forth by Korea’s delegate, who pressed the need for corporate responsibility, with Saudi Arabia presenting a global clean-up committee as a solution to the issue. \n\nIn contrast to these beliefs, Haiti accused capitalism’s structure as the primary source of the issues, stating that sovereignty is a source of pollution, with Russia also bashing the west for its actions in the matter. As an extension to the polarized committee, Brazil’s representative questioned the legitimacy of global warming, bashing the West for attempting to undermine its economy. In an exclusive interview, the delegate quoted the aid proposed during the amazon fire by the “global superpowers” as an example of the West’s ability to colonize developing states, insulting their sovereignty.\n\nAs the debate begins to heat up, the committee has forged two polar panels, with the West’s moderates taking the traditional pressing for change approach, while hardliners from Russia, Brazil, and Haiti press for the West’s true motives.

  "title": "The Role of Women in Terrorist Organizations and How it’s Being Handled ",
  "content": "UN Women, an organization in the United Nations is committed to preserving women's rights and providing further female empowerment. Over the course of a couple days, international countries have been arguing over women's roles in terrorist organizations and militias. Not only have they acknowledged the problem at hand but tried to look at the root causes which cause women to get persuaded to join these organizations. \n\n\tMany factors go into these persuasions, common ones such as:\n- Abuse - mostly from spouses\n- Trauma - childhood trauma and neglect \n- Previous directed violence - women that have been in many violent situations \n- False ideologies - false promises from terrorist organizations in order to grasp women's attention \n\nAlthough being involved in a terrorist operation is acknowledged as a horribly wrong thing, we forget to recognize how these individuals originally get involved in such actions. Finding these causes would not only help us understand their situation better but help these women get back up on their feet before they are introduced to any of these dangerous ideologies. \n\nAs the country's have been collaborating, many fresh ideas have sparked. Norway has expressed the importance of gender based research programs. They explain how this would help governments see where the specific problems are and have more knowledge on how gender affects persuasion tactics. Government studies are important but so is education for the ones affected. Though it’s  a good strategy we have to keep in mind that, still today, many countries limit, if not, do not have any education system catered to women. These education opportunities would cover how to stay smart and safe when it comes to coping with past traumas and how not to fall into terrorist traps. Countries would also have to align these programs with their peoples beliefs while making sure they spread the knowledge. The United States of America has also mentioned another possible  female run program that would help already affected women with support and guidance on how to continue on with their lives after being involved in terrorist organizations. This would include support groups and allow women to have job opportunities once again. \n\nIt’s most certainly comforting to know that countries are taking initiative towards un-talked about issues such as this one. This stigma of uncomfort around the subject has to be broken in order to permanently fix the problem.\n\n",

  "content": "American-Palestinian scholar Yousef Monayyer tweeted, \"We exported so much democracy that we don't have any left\". All that is left are unjustified Western double standards, evident in NATO’s deliberations Friday. Commenting on the Hong Kong rioters, while Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi described it as a \"beautiful sight to behold\", she condemned the U.S. Capitol breach for being \"a danger to democracy\". \n\nIn many respects, NATO members have adopted Pelosi's mindset: most consider Xinjiang’s *vocational training camps* to be a *genocide*. Principally, the USA, France, Belgium, Montenegro have been leading the push away from China, whilst Turkey, Italy, and Greece have been opting for stable, economic relations.\n\nIn line with our promise to uphold truth, we have compiled the 5 most ludicrous falsifications attributed to China’s beautiful, prosperous, and diverse Xinjiang.\n\nNo 1: A supposed \"genocide\" is being committed against the Uyghur population.\n\nThe Uyghur population has seen the most growth out of all ethnic groups in China, including the Han.

The Han population only grew 2%.\n\nNo 2: Adrian Zenz, a far-right fundamentalist Christian, claims there is forced sterilisation of Uyghur women, resulting in a decrease of the population.\n\nZenz insisted that 80% of the new intrauterine devices (IUD) insertion procedures were being performed in Xinjiang, slowing the rate of natural population growth. According to statistics from the China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019, published by the National Health Commission, the number of new IUD insertion procedures in Xinjiang accounts for only 8.7% of the national population.\n\nNo 3: BBC Newsnight reported that Zumrat Dawut (Zamira Dawut) was forcibly sterilized. \n\nDawut claimed that she had her uterus forcefully removed. However, she *voluntarily agreed* to have a cesarean section and tubal ligation at the Urumqi Maternal and Child Care Service Centre. She further claims her father died from unknown causes after being detained repeatedly. This was proven false by her brothers, Abduhelil Dawut and Elkin Dawut. In fact, her father, who has never been detained to investigated, has been living with his children before passing away to heart disease on 12 October 2019. \n\nNo 4: Fighting terrorism is merely a guise for the Chinese government to suppress ethnic minorities.\n\nChina has a total of 56 ethnic groups, and, in an area affected by separatist ideals and radical Islam, eliminating domestic terrorism is of utmost priority to the Chinese government. Since 2014, 1,588 terrorist organisations have been eliminated, 12,995 violent terrorists arrested, and 2,052 explosives impounded. By committing to eradicating domestic terrorism, China is upholding the fundamental rights to life, health, and development. Western nations wishing to manipulate the success of the Chinese people only practically serve as supporters of terrorism, a practice supposedly dreaded by them.\n\nNo 5: Foreign journalists and personnel are banned from entering Xinjiang\n\nChina welcomes all foreign journalists on the grounds of spreading the truth, abiding by local laws, and undergo procedures outlined by the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on News Coverage by Permanent Offices of Foreign Media Organisations and Foreign Journalists. In fact, more than 1,200 individuals from over 100 regions have visited Xinjiang since 2018.\n\nIt is certain that those who wish harm on China’s efforts to extirpate terrorism are de facto terrorists themselves. Xinjiang has been a land of diversity, beauty, and unity, serving as a key root of the prosperous sequoia sempervirens China aims to be. Lies and fabrications shall be scorched not by the Chinese government, but by global citizens upon discerning the threat China is to NATO’s imperialist hegemony.\n",

  "content": "In light of recent China-US meetings in Anchorage, Alaska, it is crucial to note the words of Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission: ‘[T]he United States has its…United States-style democracy, and China has the Chinese-style democracy. It is not just up to the American people, but also the people of the world, to evaluate how the United States has done in advancing its own democracy.’ \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/BfP6QhY\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PrYWP2V/Alaska-Meeting.jpg\" alt=\"Alaska-Meeting\" border=\"0\"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://freeonlinedice.com/'></a><br />\n\nNATO was formed to contain the spread of the USSR. Today, as the Union is no more, delegates are attempting to subdue China’s inevitable rise from the global dumpster to U.S. challenger. However, NATO has since expanded to meddle in foreign nations’ internal affairs, promoting their idea of ‘democracy’, invading once prosperous nations, and bombing embassies. Perhaps, it is time for NATO to establish its collective authority over the U.S.\n\nIt is worth noting the courage of numerous delegates from NATO on Friday, standing their ground against imperialist attitudes brought on by the Netherlands and the US. Notably, Italy, a G7 member, proudly advocated for the expansion of the Belt and Road Initiative and expressed gratitude for humanitarian aid provided by China during the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.",

  "title": "Child Labour in Developing Countries: The Next Step",
  "content": "Members in SOCHUM are creating alliances and presenting solutions - many of which clash - to combat child labour.\n\nAfter the delegates have stated their positions on the topic in the first session, delegates are now already getting into an intense debate in finding a solution. The delegates believe that before they can take action on the current situation, the child labourers must be first rescued from whatever labour they were forced or brought into.\n\nThe delegates are now presenting solutions. The most controversial solutions brought up include: rehabilitation programs, investment in education systems, and consumer awareness. \n\nWhile some countries believe the best way the help combat child labour is to ameliorate school curriculum, other countries certainly believe this is not the case. Delegates such as Switzerland’s delegation believe that the parents in these families are unwilling to cooperate, as they believe their children should help earn money for the family.\n\nAnother controversial topic currently being debated is rehabilitation programs. More prominent countries in the committee believe it would be a good idea to place these rehabilitation programs to help these children reform and prepare them for the future. These countries are also willing to help fund rehabilitation programs. Small and developing countries believe that this is nearly impossible as they believe the parents would disagree.\n\nSerbia believes that the reason why child labour is so popular is that so many people buy their products. Serbia’s solution to this is to “label these items with stickers so that when people buy them, they are warned, which may cause fewer people to buy these products. This ultimately causes these factories where children are working to shut down.” On the other hand, delegate of Canada has stated that “it is nearly impossible to stick a label on almost all the products. This also does no good as people will see it, but only a small amount of people will either truly care about or understand child labour.”\n\nAs time is closing in on them, and the debate is becoming more heated than ever, we anticipate that these nations will create comprehensive solutions, should they choose to collaborate. \n",

  "title": "Facebook Revived? New Ideas Discussed in Most Recent Meeting ",
  "content": "    Facebook has been facing accusations of data breaches for years. As a result, their reputation has been dismantled, and company workers are struggling to brainstorm strategies to increase user activity. Will they be able to reach a successful conclusion? New developments suggest that they may. We at Euronews have investigated behind the scenes to bring you the most recent information currently unavailable to the public. \n\n    The company is currently divided into two different groups based on the idea of whether the product or platform is of more importance.\n\n    Sheryl Sandburg, the Chief Operating Officer of Facebook suggests that Facebook expands its horizons into a new company almost as a refresher for the public. Peter Thiel, the first outside investor in the company, suggests that Facebook branches out to create more apps which seems to be the general opinion expressed, however the topic and content of said app is being currently debated, but the topic of WeWork has been brought up in discussion. \n\n    WeWork is a company that allows one to quickly and easily find accessible office spaces. Peter Thiel is advocating to create a similar app. He believes that with higher technology and the assimilation of Facebook's initial social communication, the company can build an entirely new app. With the aid of Facebook's previous popularity, he says \"we will be more successful\" than WeWork is currently. However taking into account the scandals Facebook has been involved in, Euronews is curious to see how this situation develops. This is only one side of the company's story. \n\n    The other half of the company is proposing 3 different ways to expand the user base. Robert Kimmitt, the lead independent director of Facebook gave Euronews a basic summary of ideas previously discussed. He wants to firstly expand Facebook geographically, \"targeting areas such as Indonesia\" who many not have large access to the platform. This will be a strategic move on the companies' part. The second point he kindly brought up was integration. He calls for \"product over platform\": he wants to ensure that users embrace Facebook's social culture of status updates and posts. Lastly, Facebook wants to expand interest in the product for younger ages. Currently, Facebook is seen by the younger generations as a figment of the past, and by changing this, Facebook will recover and regain popularity. \n\n    Now these two groups have congregated. As both groups share their views on the future of the company, a clear difference in opinions has been uncovered. The idea of \"product over platform\" is pitted against \"platform over product\" and spurs discussions across the company board. So far, interesting developments have revealed themselves. It appears that both sides of the company are interested in developing their platform further through reaching out to a larger audience, but the difference of opinions from individuals is seemingly preventing the majority of potential progress. Euronews is curious to see how these developments will progress in the future. ",

  "title": "America and Allies in DISEC Do Not Negotiate with Dark Web Terrorists",
  "content": "In a stunning demonstration of American values, the delegate of America firmly rejected the notion of employing hackers—convicted criminals—to combat criminal activity on the Dark Web. A majority of the committee stood with America on this issue, offering their own comparisons of the efficacies of white-hat and black-hat hackers.\n\nThe American delegate, in a compassionate and wholly American act of diplomacy, also took into consideration the beliefs of opposing parties, suggesting that if criminal hackers were to be employed, strict regulations would need to be put in place to ensure their efficacy and loyalty. For self-evident reasons, we do not consider this negotiation with terrorists; anyone that believes otherwise stands against America and its mission of world prosperity.\n\nIn a separate caucus, America led the charge on discussing the formation of an international database on Dark Web activity. The advantages of this course of action are numerous; it would allow for DISEC nations to more easily coordinate actions against the shipping of illicit materials across the world.\n\nThe delegates of North Korea and Russia doubted the plans America had presented. The former delegate was blind to the evident value of creating a database, arguing that the database itself could be hacked by dark web criminals, and the latter delegate opposed the idea of transparency surrounding the movement of arms. It is worth noting that North Korea heavily restricts its citizens access to the internet—a violation of freedom of expression—and that much information about the Russian government’s arms movements is hidden from the international community. It appears that these two nations reject America’s strides to establish an international Dark Web database not to find an alternative path to global cybersecurity, but to fulfill ulterior motives. Seeing that the detractors of the delegate of the United States have yet to establish their credibility in their committee, it is likely that in future sessions, the delegates of DISEC will find a way to combat Dark Web criminality with effective American values.",

  "title": "ChairMUN offline, EU Chair Counts Down on His Fingers for Delegates Debating Asylum Policy",
  "content": "At 8:40 in the morning, the European Union starts off their third committee session. As the committee tries to open their first session of the day, the ChairMUN program seems to have stopped working. Taking initiative, the Dais team comes up with a way to run without ChairMUN. The director instructs delegates to raise their hands as usual to vote, and in the absence of ChairMUN, delegates switch places in zoom's gallery view as they raise and lower their hands. The Dais team now uses inventive solutions to moderate debate, such as typing motions in the chat, and giving 10-second warnings by counting down on their fingers. \n\nIn their debate and discussion of asylum policy, members of the EU clash with each other. There seems to be an agreement among some delegations: notably, France, Italy, and Poland, who is wearing a gaming headset, argue that EU nations should have an appropriate quota of refugees to take in, and if not, repercussions such as sanctions should follow. The delegations of Greece raises concerns with economic situations, making reference to their state of relative economic turmoil, and is reassured by delegates in support of the quota policy that quotas will be decided for each country based on their unique situations. Germany raises their own concerns with public opinion, saying that the internal conflict in the EU, which has obviously never happened before, will make the EU look weak. The delegation of Denmark - the only delegate with their zoom video off - firmly disagrees with the proposed quota policy. They seem very eager to discuss “balancing humanitarianism with national interests”. A delegate of an opposing stance asks for an opportunity to discuss during an unmoderated caucus, and is met with awkward silence. Are they away from their computer? \n\nDespite a lack of ChairMUN, a useful tool for moderating debate, keeping the committee organized, and timekeeping for delegates, almost like an American conference, the committee is able to come up with temporary solutions and continue with fruitful discussion.\n",

  "content": "It is the year 2021 and developing nations still need our help. Sadly, many still don’t recognize or see this issue in the world but it’s growing larger everyday. The Social Cultural and Humanitarian Committee, which is a part of the UN, has recently been further discussing long term solutions. \n \nAlthough some countries are in much better shape than others, it’s still valid to recognize everyone's level of development. A topic the UN brought up is child labor. Child labour is a horrible thing happening still today but without it, many country’s economys would not be able to survive. The Kingdom of Denmark’s main concern is about the well being of children who have been victims of child labour. Therefore, they believe in the same component Iran has voiced time and time again. They believe funding should be directed into those specific economies to try and extinguish child labour once and for all.  Venezuela has also stated how they’re afraid governments may misuse the funds provided and instead they could create an international reliable body that can aid these countries. This would work in a form of  an international trust fund as brought up by the UK. \n\nCorruption is the main concern here. Many countries like Iran and Pakistan consider this very closely and are building ideas that would allow solutions to be executed safely. The way this could be a safe process is by having some sort of system where  countries report to and which monitors the progress and use of funds from governments. Ultimately, funding works differently in every nation therefore it’s hard to come to a consensus of all the world's major governments.\n\n   Although we are still battling this very significant issue, progress is definitely being made. Now that we finally recognize child labour is a major component for many econmies and a motive for many families, countries are able to progress and further develop their latest ideas. Implementing effective laws and a sense of stability for citizens is what’s vital in saving economies and possible child labour victims. \n",

  "content": "Jealousy, carefully enshrined as Othello’s hubris, is emerging once more. With the advancement of China’s 5G network, Western nations are attempting in vain to contain China, accusing China of conducting espionage, cyber-attacks, and infringing on human rights. What many nations under the American camp of NATO failed to recognise on Saturday is the economic lifeline China serves for many developing nations. Nevertheless, those who favour economic substance over political games, like Turkey, Italy, and Greece, have seen tremendous national growth and increased free trade. China has aided in many nations’ paying of debts, and improving trade linkages, lowering otherwise fixed costs of transportation. As a result, these defiant nations rose up to form the Virtually Meeting Underdeveloped Nations bloc, suspiciously shortened to VMUN. Accordingly, the title of Jane Austen’s great novel, Pride and Prejudice, is reinforced. North Macedonia eloquently put: ‘We cannot let our ***prejudice*** against China affect a great trade plan.’ \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/F0JD1Dq\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4YMVLVg/5G-China.jpg\" alt=\"5G-China\" border=\"0\"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://dedupelist.com/'>\n\nTruthfully, those remarks were generous. Western nations under severe political pressure from the United States also evoke a sense of ***pride*** as these nations are disillusioned to believe US democracy is fit for all. To oppose China, these nations have proposed a NATO Belt and Road Initiative, essentially appropriating President Xi Jinping’s signature plan under the guise of democracy. However, it is evident to developing nations that the US initiatives come with strict conditions, those bullying nations into smearing China on a global stage. Contrarily, China has been unconditional with the providing of economic and social aid, as seen during the pandemic.",

The delegation of Norway, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil echoed previous positions, all while stating they are open to compromise. Brazil further cemented its anti-west stance, quoting the lack of financial support as the true lack of care for developing states. Haiti echoed this sentiment by stating that the middle ground is critical moving forward, with countries working not as first or third world countries but instead as second world powers.\n\nTo re-establish key points in the debate, Singapore acknowledged that the ocean had become a “saucy soup of chemical waste,” stating that a one-size-fits-all solution is not a peaceful path forward. Yet, as agricultural and cosmetics waste overtakes the ocean, delegates continuously kept a seemingly calm face progressing forth with hope and blank words. \n\nIn an exclusive discussion with Saudi Arabia’s delegate, she pressed the critical need for global leaders to take the first step to pave the path for the rest of the world to follow. Saudi Arabia further questioned the global superpowers’ motives, as “they [were] the ones instigating the issues.” To add, the delegate pressed the importance of implementing the technology already available rather than spending critical resources on forging new ones.

  "title": "United States Senate on Affordable Healthcare: Featuring Exclusive Interview with Senator Bernie Sanders",
  "content": "(CNN) – Today the US Senate continues their discussion on affordable healthcare. Whilst discussing merits of different solutions, Senator Amy Klobuchar pointed out that the Senate has been able to come to a consensus on the need for more checks on pharmaceutical companies as an effort to reduce medication costs and increase transparency. The Democrats and Republicans differ in opinion on whether a universal healthcare system is too limiting, and thus diverge in how to proceed with the matter.\n \nSenator Bernie Sanders critically stresses the importance of  retaining and “expand[ing] Medicare” and “includ[ing] more Americans” to establish a long term solution. We requested an interview with Senator Sanders on the matters being discussed by the Senate, and he obliged to respond to our questions.\n \n(CNN) – What do you personally believe the definition of affordable healthcare is?\n \n(Sen. Bernie Sanders) – “I think that affordable healthcare is pretty self-explanatory – with millions uninsured in this nation…what we have at the moment is not affordable healthcare. The best way is the introduction of Medicare for all…I understand that based on political beliefs this may be difficult.”\n \n“I want to ensure that the healthcare bill we pass will extend healthcare and crack down on pharmaceutical companies…healthcare is something that should be affordable that people can actually pay for.”\n \n(CNN) – What goals does your party have regarding healthcare improvement?\n \n(Sen. Bernie Sanders) – “I think something that we were all able to agree on was that there needs to be an expansion of Obamacare and Medicare and the Obama reform act…so that is something I definitely think will be happening.”\n \n“Our goals are to increase coverage for American people, tackling pharmacare…ending surprise billing has been brought up a lot…essentially we want expansions on [our current systems] as we want more restrictions on pharmaceutical companies.”\n \n(CNN) – What strides are the Democratic Party making towards reaching your goals?\n \n(Sen. Bernie Sanders) – “Currently there are a couple bills in circulation: one of those is the React Act...[which plans] to take the existing infrastructure of Obamacare and Medicare and building on them for an increase in transparency and options available to the American people.”\n \n“What the Republicans were bringing up a lot was the possibility of an option that people are not forced into, and I can see where they are coming from. I think that the downfalls and shortcomings of having universal healthcare have been a little bit exaggerated, but what the Democratic Party has settled on is the React Act, and another bill written by Chuck Schumer that focuses more on the expansion of just Obamacare.”\n \n“Something we really have to work on right now is cementing our ideas as a party, and making sure we can come to agreement on one bill and pass that.”\n \n(CNN) – What do you anticipate the outcome of debate on this topic will be for your committee as a whole?\n \n(Sen. Bernie Sanders) – “I think when it comes to the affordable healthcare topic, there has been a bit of overlap between what Democrats and Republicans are pushing.”\n \n“Republicans are looking for repeals on Obamacare, and Democrats are looking for expansion on Obamacare and Medicare, so that is where [the parties] differ. But I think one thing everyone has been able to agree on is pharmaceutical companies, and the [overall] issue of big [pharmaceutical companies] overall.”\n \n“I think that were is absolutely, one hundred percent going to be more restrictions on pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost of prescription companies and medication for the American people.”\n \n“I have definitely seen a lot of consensus on that, and then since there is a Democratic Party majority…and I do think some Republican senators will be able to get behind it.”\n \n“At the end of the day, you have a majority, so I do predict the expansion of Medicare and Obamacare by the end of today.”\n \nCNN would like to thank Senator Bernie Sanders for joining us. While political parties and more radical concepts tend to influence such decisions - thus causing division and unsatisfactory results for many American citizens - the consensus of the Senate on doing the best for the people is encouraging and inspiring. CNN wishes the US Senate all the best in their endeavors to improve healthcare for the American people.\n",

  "content": "In the social, humanitarian, and cultural committee, a whopping fifty-one delegates discuss child labour in developing countries. Fifty-one is an impressive number for an online committee, given how difficult it can be to moderate debate and keep delegates on tasks in an online platform. Though moderating debate over Zoom can be difficult, the Dais is probably thankful for both Zoom's stellar audio quality, and the aspects of the platform that make pausing debate so delegates can form an awkward line at the podium, unnecessary. SOCHUM is running smoothly; nobody has tripped over projector wires. \n\nEven with such a large committee, a diverse selection of delegates are speaking, unlike usually in bigger committees, where the vast majority of delegates may as well not be there, many delegates are speaking on their stances and offering their solutions, and everyone has an opportunity to talk. In a committee without much major clash, there are few big debates between delegates, reducing periods of time where outsiders to the debate are denied chances to speak. Perhaps it’s less entertaining to watch arguments over an online platform. \n\nSOCHUM delegates, in their discussion about child labour in developing countries, continue to brainstorm concerns about types of exploitation, and possible solutions to the topic, including partnering with NGOs or introducing additional framework. The delegates are participating in a nuanced discussion on the difficulty of banning child labour and alternatives. \n\nWithout a doubt, these delegates mean well, and don’t actually support child labour, concerning phrases are thrown around, including “we shouldn’t outright ban child labour” (which sounds *very* concerning out of context). \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/2FvwFKy\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/QJPZJmf/Polkadots-Border-New-Year-Quotes.png\" alt=\"Polkadots-Border-New-Year-Quotes\" border=\"0\"></a>)\n\n",

As the UNSC enters into their third committee session, members are already gathering into blocs and writing resolution papers for this conflict.**\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Wnz3yBJ\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/BL6PZTM/NEW-YORK-NEW-YORK-FEBRUARY-11-Kelly-Craft-the-United-States-Ambassador-to-the-United-Nations-UN-spea.jpg\" alt=\"NEW-YORK-NEW-YORK-FEBRUARY-11-Kelly-Craft-the-United-States-Ambassador-to-the-United-Nations-UN-spea\" border=\"0\"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://dedupelist.com/'></a>\n\n\nThe delegates have all agreed that the main root of this conflict is terrorism in Balochistan. Now, the question is, how will they solve this?\n\nWhile the delegation of Vietnam believes that the best way to solve this is to send troops after establishing trust with the citizens. They would like to send humanitarian aid to help the citizens at the current moment. Vietnam has also proposed a long-term plan - backed up by many other countries who are willing to help build and fund infrastructure for the long term.\n\nYet, the delegate of Russia believes the opposite. They have clearly stated that the first step is to first build infrastructure, which will \"improve the quality of life of the citizens.\" Only after this can troops be sent to eliminate terrorists - as well as help establish trust. Along with many other countries, Russia is concerned about how the Pakistani government has been killing innocent citizens rather than BLA members.\n\nYet China states this is only an accusation and that this is certainly not the case. China has firmly stated that they will keep funding and keep putting their trust in Pakistan, as they believe that Pakistan knows best.\n\nFinally, in a ten-minute unmod, motioned by Vietnam, the committee members try and progress and discuss their resolution papers. In this unmod, many topics were discussed and debated. The most controversial solution that members questioned was: Whether aid should be or should not be sent to Balochistan. And if so, how would they do so?\n\nVietnam and France are already planning to send aid to the people and make sure they do not aid the terrorists. At the same time, Tunisia is concerned about how the aid would be sent to the citizens and how these terrorists will not seize it.\n\nThe delegates of UNSC are extremely confident in their ability to solve this crisis. But with another issue at hand which must be solved and disagreement in solutions to the Balochistan conflict, the members of UNSC are running out of time.",

  "content": "The thin, easily penetrable style of Macbeth led to the exposing of his lack of substance. Analogously, nations like the Netherlands have been overwhelmed by their unwavering will to preserve their national dignity under the hegemonic American system, often gliding over the inherent economic issues. Nonetheless, those nations with the slightest ***sense and sensibility***, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, and Hungary, have recognised China’s role in their domestic development, GDP growth, and international cooperation.\n\nThe One Belt One Road is a global infrastructure initiative led by China’s Xi Jinping, which aims to ‘to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets, through cultural exchange and integration, to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations, resulting in an innovative pattern of capital inflows, talent pools, and technology databases’. It further strives to improve education, real estate, power grids, and overall construction investments along the former trade routes, notably the Silke Road, and those of Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Zheng He. As of 2017, The Belt and Road Initiative covered more than 68 countries, 65% of the global population, and over 40% of the global GDP. Its impacts transcend the economy. During the initial stages of the pandemic, Italy received humanitarian support from China in multiple forms. \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/6FN3ZsD\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/pdntPX4/One-belt-one-road-svg.png\" alt=\"One-belt-one-road-svg\" border=\"0\">\n\nRegardless of clear, global benefits, many Western nations choose to preserve their political affiliations over the values of their citizens, ones who feel the imminent impacts of economic withering.",

  "content": "**China is unwilling to corporate with the United States, while the United States believes that China’s CPEC program is a way to gain more influence in Balochistan.**\n\nChina has stated and expressed repeatedly that they are unwilling to work with the United States of America but are willing to work with every other nation.\n\nWith two out of five permanent members of the committee having internal conflicts, it was agreed upon in the second unmoderated caucus to give them a private breakout room to discuss the problem. Members from the BBC have received access to this discussion. China explained that, because India is one of the U.S.' allies, China does not want to work with the U.S. The U.S. has realized this and has backed down from working with China. \n\nYet, at the same time, the U.S. has repeatedly stated how China's primary agenda is simply to dominate global resources. Even after this discussion, the tension between the two still exists. The U.S. still has untrust towards China, calling the CPEC a “way to expand and get an economic gain.” The U.S. keeps bringing up how the CPEC will enable China to continue to expand its sphere of influence. \n\nSome nations have already leaned towards the west, while others have leaned towards the east. Vietnam has already tried to ease this tension. The delegate of Vietnam has explained how even if China has ulterior motives, the CPEC program will still help out the Balochistan people, reducing the pressure overall.\nFrance has encouraged other countries to stay neutral rather than take sides, trying their very best to reduce the tension at the moment.\n\nWith the fourth committee session closing in on the members in the UNSC, they must find a solution not only to this. They must find solutions to the Rojava Revolution as well as the Balochistan Conflict - and we here, at the British Broadcasting Corporation, wish them the best of luck. \n",

  "title": "China Asserts That America “Cannot Be Trusted” With CPEC Development, Incites Laughter Among UNSC Members",
  "content": "The United Nations Security Council is currently deep into their debate on the conflict in Baluchistan and Pakistan. As is to be expected, the delegates of the United States and China are at the center of the ideological clash at hand.\n\nIn one caucus, the delegate of China claimed that their sole motive for working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was to “help out their neighbors.” Additionally, they claimed that America was “not to be trusted” and that the prevalent allegations of attempting to expand their geopolitical influence via debt trapping were false. Upon hearing these remarks, several delegates in the Zoom room could be seen laughing to themselves; among them was the delegate of Russia, who, despite their historical oppositions to American values, found humor in the Chinese delegate’s statement.\n\nLater, the delegate of China falsely claimed that during a one-on-one negotiation with the delegate of America, they agreed that America would completely cease their activities in South Asia and allow for China to continue progress on the CPEC. The delegate of the United States was quick to correct this misinterpretation for the committee, as they had never made any such claim. The delegate then reasserted that the increasing influence of China in Pakistani and Baluchistani affairs was a threat to global peace and that steps should be taken to limit it.\n\nA correspondent at Fox News who was present at the one-on-one negotiation confirmed that China refused to take legally binding measures to curb its expansionist tendencies.\n\nFollowing China’s inaccurate summary of the negotiations, several delegates were quick to ask for the US’s perspective on the talks. It appears that despite the polarizing nature of this issue and the prevalence of misinformation between nations, the delegate of America was able to unite a large portion of the council against the spread of Xi Jinping’s regime.\n",

  "title": "(OPINION) U.S. Politics: Amid Increased Support for Smokers, Opioid Harm Reduction a Far Cry from Reality",
  "content": "*Note: This piece is a submission from one of our readers and represents neither The Globe and Mail’s perspective or the individual perspectives of our editors, contracted writers, and patrons. *\n\nOn Saturday morning, delegates from all corners of the globe gathered at Vancouver’s Canadian High Schools Model United Nations (CAHSMUN) conference to reflect upon the health implications of air pollution, the COVID-19 pandemic, and smoking, with specific regard given to the steadily increasing prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases. \n\nFor reference, the term “chronic respiratory disease” refers to a multitude of debilitating health conditions targeting the human respiratory system, the most common of which are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, sleep apnea, and lung cancer. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, an estimated 3 million Canadians suffer from a chronic respiratory disease, the majority of whom are habitual users of nicotine and/or tobacco products. These statistics are expected to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s adverse lung effects, however research data is still being collected and will likely be released towards the end of this year.\n\nToday’s youth, the generation tasked to end smoking once and for all, are failing miserably at learning from their parents’ mistakes. In 2019, Health Canada reported that 17.8% of high school students had admitted to “vaping” within the last month.  For our southern neighbours, that statistic was 20.8% (United States Bureau of Health). \n\nAt this weekend’s CAHSMUN conference, these statistics were of utmost importance. One of the key general assemblies at the conference’s 17th iteration, the World Health Organization (WHO) opted to split the topic and critique public health ideologies and their relevance to the youth vaping epidemic. Notably, the delegation of the United States (US) advocated for an unprecedented and out of character approach: harm reduction. \n\nElizabeth Jen, the delegate representing the global giant, stated that “The United States seeks to implement designated indoor spaces within schools where youth will have the opportunity to vape in privacy”. When asked if the same safety measures would be extended to people entrenched in drug abuse of higher severity, Jen was hesitant.\n\nIn Canada, various health measures (such as our ban on youth-targeted advertising for nicotine products) have been implemented for tobacco and/or nicotine focused harm reduction; the US has failed to demonstrate any evidence of past efforts to support individuals suffering in active addiction. Thus, skepticism of these lofty proposals is not unreasonable. \n\nAs with many American policy changes, this proven-positive strategy is set to reach those with a desperate need for life-saving support last. The hypocrisy of the US pushing the envelope for nicotine and/or tobacco harm reduction while still actively inflicting terror into the lives of opioid addicts is a textbook example of class privilege in one of the world’s top democracies.\n\nFrom a Canadian perspective, we still have a long way to go, however our social and political sympathy for schedule C drug users is undeniably higher than that of the US. For example, designed to support active addicts, opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is one of the cardinal examples of harm reduction policy. This therapy is enthusiastically used in Canada and yet is also criminalized in the majority of the US. \n\nUltimately, criticism of this dangerously selective policy change is warranted by both drug users and their allies. Canada and the United States must both counter the widespread misconception that e-cigarettes are a safe alternative to “the real deal”. Active anti-oppressive work must be done in order to redefine addiction as a health disorder that deserves treatment, no matter if the user’s drug of choice is a Marlboro Red or a brown baggie of heroin. \n",

  "title": "The On-Going Conflict Happening in Balochistan ",
  "content": "\tCivil wars have re-ignited in the Balochistan province of Pakistan.With these on-going conflicts which originally sparked in the late 1940’s , you'd think things would be peacefully resolved by now. Unfortunately, conflict re-appeared once again in 2005 after the captain of the national army raped Shazia Khalid. Shazia Khalid is a very well respected female doctor in the nation, therefore  this not only angered the public but caused them to lose all trust in their government and fully overturn back into a civil war statuts.\n\n\tThe United Nations Security Council has been working tirelessly to try and calm the current situation in Balochistan. Some of the main concerns brought up by countries would include people's lack of education and the exceedingly low literacy rate of 46%. \n\n*Why is education even being discussed here? Why is it relevant? \n*\n\tWe live in an age where knowledge is vital for the human kind to progress. It’s also important to note that education plays a significant role in national development. Therefore, with such a low literacy rate and lack of resources for education, Balochistan and its people are stuck in a continuous cycle of confusion, danger and violence. No educated or progressive government officials and no people with their own opinions but rather based on corruption ideologies,  leaves the nation stuck in time. \n\n\tMany countries also brought up their concern on electoral violence. Violent transfers of power or any dangerous activities caused by the new government further disrupt the peace of the nation. This makes citizens feel unheard and angry because of their own government. The only way the people of Balochistan feel they’ll be able to be noticed is by further rebellion and disruption. \n\t\n\tNow that this cycle has been recognized we are one step closer to permanent peace. Seeing the UNSC continuously collaborate and merge their disagreements into redirections and new solutions helps the people of Balochistan have hope for the nation's future. \n",

  "content": "    \nFree health for all; is that too much to ask? This question was tackled in the Senate today, as all parties wished for the same outcome, with unique paths of achieving solutions present; the Republicans pursuing an economically favourable path, while the democrats followed a course of health care for all.\n\nAs of now, the Democratic and Republican blocs have both agreed on the measure of accountability for Pharmaceutical companies for price transparency. The Democrats wished for a national price on medicine, with negotiations among insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. The Republicans also demand that certain individuals get to override the need for payment, all while allowing for a special savings account directed at health care investment.\n\nSenator McConnel tackled the Democrats’ goal of excluding the FDA from imported drugs, forging a rumbling debate in the caucus. Tise issues set forth created a stiff skirmish among the senators, as the Democratic party entered a meltdown with their bill of loopholes. Senator Klobuchar pressed for unity and wished to pursue the broken bill; however, no successful results have been seen. \n\nSimultaneously, a rift has forged in the Senate through the Democrat’s demand for an expansion to Medicare for all, as the 32 trillion USD cost of the plan created a scapegoat for the Republican party to denounce the Democrats. As the debate elapsed, a key point was brought forth by Senator Sanders, who pressed the need for corporate responsibility, a view too extreme for the democrats.\n\nLike all bills before, it appears that the current one has the senate divided based on ideology and cost. The Republicans have stood their grounds on the high cost of the effective initiative, all while the Democrats have pressed medicare for necessary procedures. A question still stands, will this attempt for the most basic right to medicare lead to a bust or actual change?\n",

  "title": "Indigenous Self-Governance in Canada: IAC Discusses the Criminal Justice System, Moves Forward with Resolutions",
  "content": "(CNN) – Complex logistics regarding self-governance has sparked much debate within the IAC in how to approach the matter. Sheila Watt-Cloutier cites that due to “diverse cultural backgrounds”, one single method to collectively use may be ineffective. Thus, the collective brought forth many individual ideas to aid the indigenous people in leading better lives through access to education, healthcare and equal opportunities.\n \nMumilaaq Qaqqaq spoke of bridging the “socioeconomic disparity between indigenous peoples and the rest of the population” through increased job opportunities. Lorraine Whitman points out the benefits of providing “a boost to education facilities” to provide funding for furthering education. Adam Olsen wants to “recognize the culture that exists in their everyday lives”, and provide aid while respecting these customs. Blocs “Swag” and “All Stars: Shrek” convened in smaller groups. “All Stars: Shrek” places great focus on restorative measures in the criminal justice system along with providing positive influences and resources for indigenous people while promoting connections between indigenous communities and the general government. “Swag” likewise discusses reform of the criminal justice system as well as improving the education system, legislation and bringing awareness to the matter.\n \nSheila Watt-Cloutier provided the following statement on behalf of “All Stars: Shrek”:\n \n“Our main goals are increasing Indigenous self-governance (both on reserves and in urban areas), improving socioeconomic conditions of Indigenous communities, decreasing unjust police violence, increasing Indigenous representation in justice system, and enhancing reconciliation as well as connections with [the] deferral government.”\n \nSylvia McAdam Saysewahum, from “Swag” additionally provided us with the following statement:\n \n“As Indigenous people face numerous injustices within the Canadian Criminal Justice System, my bloc’s primary goal is to reinstate Indigenous self-governing systems within Indigenous communities. Another goal is to increase Indigenous representation in the executive and judicial branches of the Canadian government, so as to reduce biases against Indigenous peoples. Finally, we are recommending adjustments to Canadian Curriculum to further include Indigenous history to educate the general Canadian population on Indigenous issues.”\n \nLiving up very much to their namesakes, blocs “Swag” and “All Stars: Shrek” have wonderfully approached the matter of self-governance with meaningful steps, and make positive strides towards passing effective resolutions. As a message to all delegates, we quote the wise words of the dais: “go outside, touch the grass, and we will see you in a little bit”. \n",

  "content": "What happens when the current European Union Asylum Policy fails to do its job? It has caused countries in the EU to receive an overwhelming amount of refugees, and its delegates are trying to solve this problem. Ever since the 2000s, countries in the European Union have admitted an overwhelming number of refugees and asylum seekers, which has sparked much controversy. Many of these nations have already accepted many refugees, and most governments do not want to receive them anymore. \n\n<a href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jhcfhTj/download-2.jpg\" alt=\"download-2\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nAlthough the EU has alloted ample monetary and physical resources to this cause, these refugees remain at-risk citizens of their new (or temporary) homelands. In the sober words of Poland, “we believe that we do not have enough materials to help these refugees... [and] there are many anti-refugee protests and sentiments in our country.” Not all countries would like to take in these refugees; once refugees are rejected from one nation, they continue to knock on other doors, and as a result, refugees are unable to settle.  \n\nAn idea that was brought up in the committee was by using quotas. Poland believed that refugees should be taken by countries with space rather than smaller countries, as these refugees would only get shunned by the citizens in these smaller countries. Yet, Italy posed this question: \"How low can countries set their quotas?...If countries can just set their [quotas] to [be disproportionately low], what would happen to the refugees who weren’t taken in?” \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/ch8dXTj\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/GQMj3Pq/54926357-101.jpg\" alt=\"54926357-101\" border=\"0\"></a><br />\n\nAs the BBC, we see both the beneficent and dangerous potential of quotas. We recognize that conservative current European citizens may celebrate the prospect that EU member states would lower their refugee intake. But we also recognize that the implementation of a massive quotas system will incentivize most other nations to follow suit, making meeting basic needs more difficult for all displaced persons. \n\nUltimately, after some modification of the ideas and solutions the EU has presented, we here at the British Broadcasting Corporation believe that they will solve this issue once and for all. \n",

To Xinhua’s shock, this arrangement fabricated some objectively *inclusive* proposals, including creating subcommittees, allocating funds, listing past UN resolutions, and finding *multifaceted* solutions.

  "content": "    UN Women has been advocating for women's rights throughout this entire session. The specific topic at hand is women's roles in terrorist groups. So far, most member states have merged blocs in order to structure a detailed resolution paper which has just been passed. Euronews is pleased to see this progress and hopes for the continuation of this cooperation between delegates. \n\n    For a brief background on this topic, the committee is focusing on the recruitment of women into terrorist organizations, their roles, and the reasons behind their recruitments. Especially in rural areas or third-world countries, women are more likely to be recruited by terrorist groups. The majority of these women face relentless abuse from their superiors in the organization. UN Women is working quickly to find solutions in order to stop this cycle from continuing on and causing harm around the world. \n\n    The resolution paper's three most crucial points included providing as many vulnerable women with basic needs as possible, education against recruitment, and empowerment in communities. Euronews didn't catch the entirety of the session, but the information below is what we gathered. \n\nUN Women wishes to decrease poverty rates among women because having basic needs met reduces the likelihood of being recruited into terrorist organizations. The second point around the education against recruitment is straightforward: it endorses educating women, particularly in rural areas or third-world countries, about how to stay safe and the personal safety concerns associated with working in a terrorist organization. The third and final point is around empowering women in the system. This is quite possibly the hardest section of their paper to achieve, but Euronews has faith in the abilities of the tireless members of the UN Women's committee. ",

  "title": "OP-ED: America’s Support of UNEP “ONCELER” Paper is a Symptom of a Weak-Spirited Biden Administration",
  "content": "*A correspondent of Fox News has received an early version of the working paper in the United Nations Environmental Program known as the “Ocean Non-Contamination Elected Leaders Embracing Reform” (abbreviated as “ONCELER”). The following is an opinion piece discussing it.*\n\n----------\n\n\n\nLet’s begin with the most jarring aspect of this working paper: its name, a nod to a Dr. Seuss book about an orange monkey who “speaks for the trees.” But trees are inanimate objects. Who will speak for those who need to be heard—the people?\n\nThis is the failure that I see in the ONCELER paper: the nations of the UNEP are assigning arbitrary hoops for themselves to jump through, diverting intelligence and resources away from living people and strong economies.\n\nPerhaps the saving grace of this paper is that most of it is non-binding. However, the regulations on oil, plastic, and other chemical wastes that it urges nations to impose on themselves would merely hinder the efficacy of American industry. It is also worth noting that President Trump, in repealing nearly one hundred environmental regulations during his term, was able to continue the growth of the American GDP, hinting at economic potential in environmental deregulation.\n\nBut the ONCELER is just a set of “recommendations,” so in return, I recommend that the Biden government forgoes them.\n\nEven if I were to buy into the mission of climate action that the ONCELER paper sets for itself, it would still fall short! The UN-sponsored ocean waste management exams and certifications it seeks to establish are empty virtue signals—only this time, on a global scale—and the “reverse vending machines” it proposes already exist in the form of plastic depots. Neither of these “solutions” have or will transport the world out of the dangers the UNEP deluded itself into seeing.\n\nDo I believe that humans have contributed to climate change? Maybe. But whether or not we have matters less to me than the fact that it is a naturally occurring phenomenon. None of the arbitrary restrictions outlined in the ONCELER paper will cause environmental change on the same order of magnitude as the forces of nature; they will only make it more complicated for industries—for working class Americans—to remain alive.\n",

  "title": "Facebook Working Concerningly Hard to be an Even Bigger Part of Your Life",
  "content": "In society, we have a general consensus that Facebook is very trustworthy, and we would love for it to expand into even more sectors of our lives. Luckily, the Facebook committee has some ideas.\n\nThe Facebook committee’s first topic is structured to be a case competition of sorts, delegations are to form blocs to make presentations of business ideas, and present them to judges.. The content of their presentations revolves around competition with Tencent. Blocs have come up with ideas for Facebook, such as new features, improvements on current features, and sectors that the company can invest and participate in. \n\nOne such case, presented by Rober Kimmitt, Mike Schroepfer, and Nancy Killefer, focuses on three main goals: expanding the user base, incorporating and nurturing a monetary system, and integrating more Facebook services into daily life. This case aims to target potential users that are in a younger age group, and potential users in Africa. This case encourages Facebook to start a PR campaign to attract more users. One of the two target audiences is younger people, who use Facebook less than older generations. The young, hip, cool zoomers don’t want to use a boring platform like Facebook, that’s for boomers. The PR campaign aims to change this view. The second of the case’s target audiences is African users. As neither Facebook nor Tencent services are particularly popular in Africa yet, this group encourages Facebook to take action and to trap African users in the Facebook ecosystem before competitors can trap said African users in their own. Their second big idea of a monetary system is made up of features such as Facebook pay™, rewarding loyal users with Facebook gift cards™ that can conveniently be deposited into Facebook accounts™ or spent on Facebook shops™, and give monetary incentives such as cashback, especially to those poor African countries that would jump at an opportunity for a social media and a payment system to take over their lives. Another main idea revolves around integration into daily lives, encouraging facebook to acquire companies and have stakes in even more sectors, and developing and introducing AR to daily life and social media. \n\nThe second case, presented by Mark “zucc” Zuckerberg, Antonio Lucio, and Sheryl Sandberg, had ideas just as creative. They detail areas of competition with Tencent as well, and present their own case. Again with three pillars, the case encourages Facebook to work on a payment system, and even hold capital and act as a bank, platform integration, and expansion into other sectors. The presenters acknowledge that Facebook has a steady and reliable growth in user base and in profit, but lacks innovation. Their first big idea, very similar to the first bloc, as capitalism breeds innovation, is of a payment system. The case encourages Facebook to partner with PayPal, an established payment method, to convince users that they can definitely trust facebook’s payment system, and should definitely abandon their banks and credit card companies for Facebook. The case ambitiously proposed that Facebook eventually develop into a bank and hold capital, so Facebook can now control both your social media and your money! Secondly, the case details a plan to increase platform integration; Mark Zuckerberg tells us that this would look like an extension on the Facebook app to offer features useful in everyday life, such as a way to download and read books, order food, read news, and even hire personal trainers all on Facebook. with this extension, you won’t need any other apps on your phone, and you can spend all your time and money on Facebook! This bloc, once again similar to the bloc before, is expanding into other sectors, specifically VR. Surprisingly unlike the previous bloc, this bloc singles out the gaming industry in particular, and focuses on more underdeveloped and unconventional sections, such as VR, AR, and Neuralink technologies. \n\nMaybe capitalism does breed innovation after all; Facebook delegates came up with some creative, innovative, and concerningly invasive ideas to broaden Facebook’s reach even more. With these amazing ideas, not only will Facebook know all of your information and interests, it can bring more features, become an even bigger part of your life! \n\n",

  "content": "*This article reflects the opinions of the author, not necessarily those of Xinhua.*\n\nDISEC’s Saturday proposals have been shaky. Iraq’s solution of utilising private hackers to host training courses for government cybersecurity personnel comes with the potential of the eradication of a people’s government, turning it into one dominated by corporate tech giants. Regardless of political ideology, a government must represent its citizens through its own sacrifices. The Iraqi bloc’s plan assured lukewarm delegates that individual hackers, upon completing background checks, would not gain information to sensitive data. This works fair-and-square until the moment it is implemented. With increased government dependency on individuals and corporations to train government officials on hacking, the interests of said groups would be catered towards, devaluing what the West broadcasts as democracy. Through efforts made by an Iran-US bloc, the draft resolution failed to succeed, reassuring the global community of cyber-secure governments.\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/qgKvF32\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DMhZgHj/Hacker-computer-cyber-security.jpg\" alt=\"Hacker-computer-cyber-security\" border=\"0\">\n\nIt is impossible to see why governments are unwilling to spend money themselves to combat cybercrime, especially considering governments are often victims. This is not a time to promote decentralised behaviour. Global governments need to rise to face the dangers of the dark web as opposed to relying on civilians. A concentrated government can efficiently and effectively carry out operations as seen in President Xi’s war on corruption. It is of particular interest to western laggards to ramp up efforts to eradicate major cyber threats once and for all. \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/JCsgZtj\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/g6RhY9Z/Anti-Corruption-China.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Corruption-China\" border=\"0\"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://imgbb.com/'>\n\n*Nonetheless, Xinhua would like to commend the Assistant Director of DISEC in particular for his eloquent adjectives.*",

  "title": "NATO’s Portugal: Cooperation Can Exist Without Political Uniformity",
  "content": "With the rise of China’s cryptocurrencies, the west once again feels threatened by an amicable initiative. Xinhua has had the honour of interviewing NATO’s own Portugal, providing us with some insight as to how the often arbitrary distinction is made between politics and economics.  \n\n\n----------\n\n\n(Xinhua) Good morning, Portugal. It is a pleasure to have you here. Generally speaking, how has China benefitted Portugal?\n\n>Since Portugal’s economic crisis beginning in 2010, China has made investments into various Portuguese business sectors including power grid operators, banks, insurance companies, and real estate. Through these Chinese investments, Portugal was able to alleviate the long term consequences of the economic crisis whilst simultaneously speeding up national economic redevelopment.\n\n(Xinhua) We heard the US delegation mention China’s national security threat. As a US ally, how have you been coping with this immense political pressure?\n\n> Our prime minister has made it clear on the international stage many times, that allies come first, and economic ventures always come second. We see the US as an ally, and we see our partnerships with China as solely economically driven.\n\n\n(Xinhua) Hungary stated the US has the ‘most comprehensive cyber network’ and noted that cybersecurity is used defensively in most nations. Do you think defensive use of cyber networks is justified?\n\n> Cybersecurity measures used defensively are beneficial to maintaining national security. By intercepting prospective attacks by malicious groups or other governments, a nation can prevent catastrophic damage on its web infrastructure and privacy from being achieved.\n\n(Xinhua) The US has a branch of the military that is the Cyber Command. Don’t you think this poses a greater threat to international security than individual companies in China?\n\n> It could be said that the Cyber Command poses a greater threat. However, Portugal has yet to invest in the research which might determine who is of greater risk.\n\n\n(Xinhua) France alleged that Huawei must send information to the government. As we all know, Huawei is an independent company that is not aligned with the Chinese government. What are your thoughts on these accusations?\n\n> China is an economic partner to Huawei and to China. Our delegation would not be able to comment on these accusations. However, the United States’ pre-decided stance on China’s technological ascendance warned that allowing a foreign nation, especially China, to have control over something as crucial to a country’s ability to function as its national telecommunication platform would be a critical mistake that could lead to an eventual state of dependence on China. Regardless, in the nature of a partnership, the economically-driven alliance between Portugal’s Altice and China’s Huawei will be a joint development of 5G services in our country, in which Huawei’s technologies will be employed, whilst Altice will continue to hold absolute control over the system. These foreign involvements with Portugal’s businesses have been and will continue to be controlled, preventing any threats to national security from arising.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThe Xinhua News Agency would like to wholeheartedly express our gratitude towards Portugal’s valiant fight in NATO for truth and transparency. We also thank its commitment to openness through today’s interview.",

  "title": "ILO: Japan’s Chinese Prison Probe Reignites Age-Old Sino-Japanese Feud",
  "content": "Just one week away from the 126th anniversary of the first Sino-Japanese War, tensions between the long-lived adversaries have once again reached their boiling point. During the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) fourth committee session, the delegation of Japan committed a diplomatic misstep, thus tripping the trigger wire of the East’s most explosive nation and allowing fellow delegates to experience the front lines of one of modernity’s worst feuds, reignited.\n\nImproving prison labour conditions was the topic at the top of the ILO’s action-packed agenda. Not even five minutes after roll call, Sweden, the United States of America (USA), the People’s Republic of China (PROC), and Japan, were submerged in a high stakes debate on the ethics of prison surveillance. \n\nDuring one particularly combative exchange of verbal warfare, Japan’s delegate chose to boldly go where no man of the committee had gone before and acknowledge the elephant (rather, the panda) in the room: China’s Uyghur genocide. The representative argued that the United Nations owed consideration to the marginalized group’s shockingly familiar circumstances, and this allusion to Europe’s failure in identifying the Holocaust’s concentration camps was very well received. In a brief following speech, the Japanese delegate made one final inflammatory comment, this time on Chinese prisons’ mandatory recitations of the Chinese national anthem, in response to which the PROC further deflected the blame onto the USA’s daily Pledge of Allegiance. \n\nJapan, however, was committed to seeing China pay. The representative urged allied nations to hold China accountable by collectivizing diplomatic clout in order to overpower the nation, with the end goal being to force China to welcome outside inspectors into their “re-education camps”\n\nWithout a hint of vitriol, the PROC’s delegate adamantly condemned the US’s alleged past Sinophobic statements, before subtly omitting the word “genocide” from all five of his speeches on the topic. China utilized this opportunity to promote its traditionally dogmatic justice system through strawmanning the prospect of a multifaceted treatment, citing prison simply as a place of punishment, not rehabilitation. At the end of the delegate’s informative speech, however, an ominous message was attached: the PROC “advised” Japan that it would do them well to keep their interests far outside of the Chinese state.\n\nMake no mistake, these words are no far cry from those that led to China’s split from not only Japan, but the USSR (Russia), as well. Further distancing between the two most powerful eastern nations does not bode well for extradition conditions, which Canada also takes a deep interest in.* Canadians, take care. In times of war, our allies have always proved steadfast. \n\n*See Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.\n",

  "content": "*Present or quilty*? This was the alarming sound the Republicans echoed in the chamber of deception last night, as the senate finally opened a wound deep-rooted in American History: Black marginalization. \n\nAs senators acknowledge the issues faced by the minorities, little empathy was shown from the right, as the cloud of privilege simply imitated the same sentiment as the Jim Crow days reworded for the era. Notably absent, the majority leader Senator Schumer forfeited his given opening speech, pushing the senate to its feet. \n\nStriking arguments were presented by both sides, engulfing all possible solutions to the infrastructural issues plaguing America today, precisely the problems of zoning, education, and transportation. \n\nOn the topic of inappropriate zoning, senator McConnell presented a mediocre argument in that re-zoning projects may lead to a collapse in housing prices and the loss of neighbourhood identity. As a rebuttal, senator Sanders quoted recent rezoning projects’ success and the need for further attempts to solve the affordable housing crisis.\n\nTo tackle the issue of marginalization, the topic of education was also loosely discussed, as the Republicans promised little to no change. On this topic, Senator Sanders made key points on attempting to forge a dialogue with communities and that any money leaving federal pockets for education is being invested in America’s future, “not spent.”\n\nAs the debate elapsed, the senate fought one last debate on transportation, as two polar paths were paved for the senate to follow. The first path was set by the Democrats, as Senators wished for federal expenditure in the field, citing the failures of the private transport system set forth today. The Republicans, as always, blindly pushed against the democrat’s words setting the debate at a blocked road. In the face of the debate’s resumption tomorrow, a much-needed bill is expected, but the bill’s contents are up in the air.\n",

Has China been selling illicit goods to militia across the world through cryptomarkets? Surely this brave committee will be able to figure this out. Multiple countries such as South Korea, the Netherlands, and USA have ensured that a proper investigation will take place before any accusations are made. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to trace who is responsible for this concerning matter as it seems that the leaders of this cryptomarket are using fake identities and credit cards to ensure secrecy. Nevertheless, these courageous delegates are moving towards creating a solution to eliminate this global arms threat. Impressively, the committee has already all agreed on launching an international investigation, combining forces to ensure the world's safety. Presently, the means of conducting this investigation is being discussed, with many countries pitching in. Can this effort pay off? Negotiation around this investigation seems to be going well, and Euronews is hopeful for the best outcome. Good luck to DISEC and all of the delegates.

  "content": "Coming into the ninth committee session of the conference, and the first one of the day, the UN Women scrambles to mitigate a crisis. A terrorist group by the name of ISIL is upset by actions taken by UN Women to free women from terrorist groups’ control. Having taken thirty thousand of girls and women hostage, ISIL plans to force these women into unwilling suicide bombings. Suicide bombings will happen every twenty minutes, in selected cities, and it is up to the delegates to take action to prevent the tragedy to occur in these cities. Many delegates have spoken and condemned the terrorist group, as it’s super important to condemn terrorist groups before taking action. UN Women comes up with suggestions in the favour of the safety of the hostages, such as economic sanctions, and gathering all women in one place to be defended, or evacuate all women to a rural area, all very feasible. New York City is to be the first target, though delegates are hard at work to protect the city. In the committee, a delegate finally speaks of an investigative operation, and suggests that delegates make an effort to find information on the terrorist group. Proposing slightly more feasible solutions, UN Women now suggests that countries take measures to screen and investigate any unknown people and missing women. Continuing to make plans of military intervention and force, the committee discusses how it may be difficult to employ this force, and makes suggestions such as an undercover operation. Now, delegates are discussing the benefits of public service announcements, and how women can be helped by an educational announcement. Good luck to the UN Women in their crisis. Overall, the committee has taken a productive start, we hope to bring you positive news soon.\n",

An unidentified terrorist group originating from Syria has systematically launched attacks on innocent citizens, leading to refugees fleeing from the west across the Mediterranean. Having reached the borders of Greece, refugee camps have become overcrowded and unable to accommodate the mass influx of refugees. \n\nSyria’s government has responded to the crisis by stating that they do not have any connection to the terrorist group, and believes the group is being funded by a foreign government. Most delegates agree upon the proposal to relocate asylum seekers; however at this point only Italy and Portugal has agreed to take in refugees. Under the circumstances, Ireland proposed to investigate further into the terrorist group, which had also been discussed earlier in the crisis. No further information is available on this terrorist group at the moment. \n\nItaly proposes to collaborate with the Syrian government to find access to communications and gain access to the terrorist group. Preparation towards accommodating the refugees have been made with a public directive planning transportation methods. Contrasting opinions surround this public directive, as resources currently are being spread thin. Notions surrounding providing humanitarian aid to the current refugees is also a matter of discussion. Greater progress is in the works by the delegates. On that note, a new crisis update has been made available: several overcrowded refugee sites have been attacked, bombed, and hostages have been taken; and the delegates must immediately take action.\n",

Democratic Senator Gillibrand finds a way to keep debate in circles, insisting on discussing logistics surrounding injection sites. In this Fox News correspondent’s opinion, such a topic should be discussed after crisis events have long since passed; right now, I believe that Senators should instead focus on how drugs circulated around America.

Hospital beds have become less and less readily available due to the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: the public health authority is not prepared to handle a second crisis. \n\nSystemic racism in the medical field affects up to 78% of Indigenous Canadians (College of Family Physicians of Canada), and distrust for health professionals is often warranted. Moreover, racial disproportionalities (including higher risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, addiction, mental illness, and COVID-19) in Canadian healthcare mean that Indigenous individuals are far more likely to experience trauma due to poor compassion from health professionals. \n\nUnder Cermaq’s industry reign, this incident has been the first spill in the Norwegian fish farming corporation’s decades of community service. Nations such as the Wagmatcook Nation are frustrated due to the ecological destruction of the waterways in which they have been sustainably practicing cultural hunting practices for millenia. Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC) member Mumilaaq Qaqqaq is calling for an immediate criminal investigation into this matter. Promising justice to her supporters, Qaqqaq believes that this is an example of corporate racism. \n\nContaminated water is not only present in Cape Breton. Nations across all Canadian provinces have suffered under boiled water advisories, many of which are still in place, today.

  "content": "*The following text contains large words required by the directors of the IPC. Those with **hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia** are advised to refrain from reading. Contact a medical professional if necessary.*\n\nThe **soi-disant** Senator Amy Klobuchar claims that they are almost done writing their directive to shut down injection sites to protect the American people. She is currently looking for co-sponsors to her directive.\n\nGiven that a crisis is at hand, the Senate is less **obstreperous** than it was when discussing its regular topics yesterday. In fact, it seems that they have found a common ground, devoid of devious partisan **taradiddles** and mutterings.\n\nTo further facilitate the progress of the committee, Co-Director Othman Mekhloufi allows the committee to forgo collecting sponsors for their directives. When there are more drugs per capita in all of America than there were in **Lollapalooza** during the summer of 2012, standard crisis procedures must be shed in order to increase decision making efficacy.\n\nDirectives are now being passed. One called “Operation Safe Bamboo,” which calls for drug testing next to safe consumption sites meets widespread acclaim from the committee. Additionally, a directive from Klobuchar and Cruz—a bipartisan bill that even Co-Director Mekhloufi says “frankly does not need any debate—also “overwhelmingly passes.” Only time will tell what the outcomes of these motions will be.\n",

  "content": "(CNN) – With development received of several overcrowded refugee sites being attacked with hostages being taken, delegates are working rapidly to pass public directives. Many such directives are present floor in this moment, focusing on providing aid additionally to investigating. Identification of motive, current action is presently a priority. \n\nGermany proposes protection of personal borders as well as formation of a security group to investigate refugees to prevent further attacks on civilians. Denmark believes refugees are being targeted individually, thus launching a private investigation on this matter. Another public directive aims to negotiate a ceasefire, as well as contacting Syrian government for further action. This group has been named as ARM, standing for Asylum Resistance Movement.\n\n(Opinion) – Such attacks are clearly systematic, well organized, not to mention, well-funded. Delegates should further investigate financial backing of this organization. No such large scale launch on a mass population of people could come without access to complex communications systems, likely a connection to a massive private organization, or even a foreign government, as was stated from Syria’s government. ARM is no small, independently acting organization. As they have passed by recognition by so many groups, they are likely being assisted by another unidentified party.\n",

  "content": "In UN Women, delegates continue to work to solve this ongoing crisis. After an introduction of morning crisis, a main focus of UN Women so far has been to investigate along with evacuating women. New York City, targeted by ISIL, has successfully prevented any casualties by a ten billion dollar evacuation plan. Planning an attack on New York City, ISIL arrives to find New York empty. Actions taken by delegates have successfully prevented any casualties, as announced in a crisis update by a terribly outdated meme, detailing a baby in a green shirt, captioned “success”. Without time to celebrate their success, delegations in UN Women now work towards a repeat of their successful protection of New York. With both a focus on current, crisis-mitigating directives, as well as long-term rehabilitation plans for those who need help, UN Women continue to discuss their topic. With a concerning amount of discussion on establishment of long term, rehabilitation programs for a committee in a crisis. Delegations make suggestions on all specifics of this proposed rehabilitation program, many suggest putting up “makeshift facilities”, comparable to refugee camps, that include psychiatrists for counselling, as well as social workers. As this committee discusses rehabilitating women that they have not rescued yet, we hope to bring you updates as well as good news soon. \n",

  "content": "As a colonial power, Holland has been accused of committing colonial crimes by taking Colombia for themselves. Haiti has further alleged that developed nations do not value developing ones, producing said accusations. Under guises of foreign aid, foreign nations would be able to control developments of South American nations, much like how America topples foreign governments. Given poverty, Haiti further claims that sanctions against Colombia would prove harmful. Despite this, numerous nations have unsuccessfully campaigned for cutting trade with Colombia if they do not further exploit their citizens. \n\nNations like Russia proposed an ‘iron fist’ approach, noting efficiency over all else. Surprisingly, Saudi Arabia has been relatively moderate, with calls to involve UNSC in their mediating efforts. More practical approaches have been proposed by countries like Norway, advocating for sending medical personnel. This would prioritise humanitarian aid above politics. Furthermore, it is uncertain at this point as to whether or not any aid is unconditional, like those China offers. \n\nIt has been found that buildings constructed in Colombia are dams. Thus, Haiti reminded delegates that their committee, UNEP, fundamentally favours alternate power sources, like hydropower. Furthermore, Haiti is willing to spend $100 million to support Russia. Denmark, a delegate originally from ASEAN, notes importance of reinforcing dams instead.\n\nOccasionally, efforts to save protestors have been made.\n\n*This article was written untainted by 'the's or 'and's*",

  "content": "\nThis weekend, Globe + Mail was granted an immense privilege. This opportunity that was bestowed upon us was an interview with Jody Wilson-Raybould, one of Canada’s most infamous Indigenous politicians. Paramount values in Wilson-Raybould’s governmental role are honesty, integrity, sustainability, equity, etc… Thus, Wilson-Raybould has always stood my her moral compass. \n\nWhen asked if she believed that Trudeau got away with silencing her (during Canada’s SNC Lavalin affair) because she was an Indigenous woman, Wilson-Raybould was unsure how to respond. While she does believe that Indigenous women are often silenced by governmental officials (including law enforcement), Wilson-Raybould refused to condemn Trudeau as a racist. A proud Member of Parliament representing Vancouver-Granville, Wilson-Raybould is passionate about fighting against anti-Indigenous racism. When asked how anti-Indigenous racism is relevant to pipeline development debates, Wilson-Raybould dispelled myths of “free, prior, informed consent”, fair representation for Indigenous Canadians, democracy within band councils, etc... According to her political activist perspective, consent is not understood by our Canadian government. Wilson-Raybould wishes for reconciliation, however questions if it will be achieved within her lifetime. \n\nWilson-Raybould overall considers herself an optimist, however she reminded Globe + Mail that when one’s identity is attempted to be crushed for hundreds of years, it is difficult to remain loyal to both one’s national, cultural, racial identities. Globe + Mail thanks Wilson-Raybould for her cooperativeness. We hope to interview her again in coming days. \n",

  "content": "\nAt the halfway point of the morning crisis, delegates of the UN Women committee are hard at work. Delegates are coming up with lollapaloozas of speeches and ideas to further their situation. One particular solution that we’ve been hearing about is a plan to group women in rural areas, away from cities that the soi-distant terrorist group ISIL has announced they would attack. A delegate has brought up a concern of this plan, on the basis that this terrorist group may be telling taradiddles about their plans, and they may change their plans to attack the gathered group of women. After all, their target is women, not cities. It would be very easy to locate this camp, as big groups of people tend to be obstreperous. The committee continues to discuss, mainly clashing on whether preventative measures are of more importance, or current action. Delegates, acknowledging that time and resources are limited, must take action soon, or else the city of Paris, the current target of ISIL, will be in danger. With the effort, power, and jurisdiction of the UN Women committee, we’re sure they will be able to save Paris just as they did New York City, and hopefully be rewarded with the picture of the green shirt baby once again.\n",

  "content": "The obstreperous Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC) could be heard throughout several halls of this morning’s Canadian High Schools Model United Nations (CAHSMUN) committee session. In a heated crisis debate, delegates rushed to speak and often interrupted each other and broke traditional United Nations decorum, as well as social decorum. The room became even louder when Mumilaaq Qaqqaq was caught in a petty taradiddle. When describing her community’s identity, Qaqqaq was quick to assume that all Indigenous people are against commercial fishers. This could not be further than the truth, as due to systemic poverty within Canadian Indigenous communities, many of these people do not have the privilege of ecological consciousness. Grand Chief Stewart-Phillip was also attacked by criticism when fellow delegates accused him of collaborating with the Cermaq corporation in order to receive a hefty sum. These accusations were found to be unfounded, however the accusatory delegate (who will not be named) continued in their soi-disant style of debate and repeatedly came to the most extreme of conclusions. Although the Indigenous Advisory Council was founded with the purpose of unity amongst the diversity of Indigenous Canadians, today’s lollapalooza was the poorest demonstration of integrity that The Globe and Mail has witnessed in years. With racial tensions in Canada that constantly fight to deconstruct and invalidate Indigenous excellence, this committee session could not be a worse contribution to the public reputation of the diverse group. In terms of language use, many delegates such as (Jody Wilson-Raybould) carried immense diction, whereas other delegates seemed to possess a newfounded hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.",

  "content": "The obstreperous nation of Italy was in crisis mode, as it was left alone without any form of support. This lack of support came in light of the German’s accusation of poisoning attempts by the Italian side, a taradiddle in an attempt for unity. In response, the delegation of Italy, soi-disant as ever,  abused the chat, calling the dais bias and asking for a revolution, a sentiment suppressed by the dictators in the caucus. The directory of providing arms to Cameroon soon took over the caucus as groups wanted to over through the Cameeronean government for their failures in the issues. As the debate elapsed, the committee fought one last debate on the issue of keeping the party in Italy going, as two polar paths were paved for the delegates to follow. The first path was set by the inaudible nation of Italy through their wish for a larger party and a greater nuclear war, citing the basis of the committee as the role of the issues. The more rational delegates, however, overlooked the issue and asked for military aid against the terrorist groups present in the region, a lollapalooza set of solutions. As journalists from the New Times returned from the scene, their papers littered with a sense of  hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia, provided little to no aid. As no solutions appear possible, a much-needed leader is needed, but it is unclear if anyone will rise to the plate. \n",

Throughout all of this mess, Brazil has not yet been asked their opinion on the dams. \n\nLuckily, we have gotten an exclusive statement from them, showing that they do in fact support breaking down dams. This is because they believe indigenous tribes are stunting economic growth and the only way to make sure that they aren't affecting the country's infrastructure is to eradicate them. They violently express how the dams that are destroying the village are doing it for them already and if they don't do the whole job then it will have made it a lot easier for the country to wipe them off the face of the earth. Many countries are shocked at Brazils thinking and are afraid of the long statements and words Brazil has stated, more so, they are experiencing a hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. \n\nAlongside this, there seems to be a new soi-distant god or rather cult being formed among countries such as Brazil and Haiti. Many countries such as Norway, believe this religion is just a taradiddle and are committed to further investigating this manner. The countries which believe in this new being, describe it to be very lollapalooza like. \n",

Ireland, the newest “best friend” speaks out accordingly. Ireland states this will be a long, arduous process. Ireland states “she ain’t Pitbull” and is far too “nationalistic”. \n\nThe current focus is to investigate Bob Stewart and act accordingly. Some delegates propose execution as a possible solution to the current predicament. The Director points out that the word of Bob Stewart may be unreliable. Delegates plan to take their word with grains of salt, and accordingly plan action. The bombing of Syria, and connections to Poland is still a subject of debate within. Public directives are in the works to find out the origin and working point of ARM. Ireland has so far not gotten contact from Bob Stewart, which they are “really, really sad about”. In an update, the government of Poland has now released statements stating Poland will not negotiate with terrorists. Poland condemns their actions and plans to persecute those individuals that go against the court of Polish law accordingly. As delegates move back into moderated debate, the discussion surrounding Bob Stewart has faded, focus returning to aiding the refugees.\n",

It is alleged that the company originated from China although they are not affiliated with the government. They claim the dam was built to venerate a god. A ***soi-distant*** delegate sent an amateur scientist to collect rock samples from the dam, which accidentally resulted in its bursting. \n\nIn the Q&A section, some ***lollapalooza*** questions were asked despite not gaining much useful information. Brazil has reasserted the importance of the economy over indigenous rights, noting they will aid Haiti in efforts to continue with the dams, increase military presence, and enforce crackdowns. Haiti has been convinced to be converted to venerate this supposedly almighty god. Russia, on the other hand, has become moderate, whilst China reaffirms its independence from the corporation building dams. \n\nNonetheless, it still seems that all delegates have ***hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia***, the fear of long words. Many longer words have more complex meanings, reducing the need for overall modifiers. But, due to this fear, delegates have been constrained to lengthy speeches and directives. It is uncertain if Haiti’s veneration of the supposed god would be short-lived as a result of length.\n",

While easy comforting, these common misconceptions are harmful. \n\nToday, Canada often hides behind a benevolent, polite facade. Too scared to face criticism, systemic racism is cleverly hidden. Canadians must understand that totem poles do not guarantee inclusion. Anti-Indigenous biases are everywhere, and oftentimes invisible to non-Natives. \n\nAccording to Canadian activists, the “support” given to Indigenous peoples is performative. These people do not need wasteful public projects, they need substantial mental healthcare. Tired of hearing false promises, our Indigenous people need action, not words and cheap lies. \n\nAccording to the First Nations Health Authority, Indigenous Canadians are struggling to maintain two identities. Duality in oneself is paramount to understanding the Indigenous cause: non-Natives must acknowledge and understand this. Even discussions of one’s homeland can be triggering: most Natives do not have homelands. The Indigenous Advisory Council strongly encourages all non-Native people to contemplate their settler privilege at least once each day. The fight against colonialism is not only that of Indigenous peoples, as Advisor Mumilaaq Qaqqaq pointed out. Racially privileged Canadians must use their power to dismantle the systems of oppression which unfairly benefit them. \n\nThe Globe and Mail acknowledges the unceded traditional Indigenous territories on which we live, learn, and fight for equality within Canadian journalism. \n",

  "content": "The violence in Pakistan's largest province, Balochistan, continues. Numerous countries are gathering ideas but they keep failing to agree while time keeps running out. Russia, a famous world power known to be able to make or break a nation, is also involved in this debate. This afternoon, the New York Times got a couple of minutes to speak with the representative on some of the following topics that were brought up. \n\nFirstly, the committee spent lots of time expressing the importance of education in saving the nation of Balochistan. Russia trusts that education is crucial for any society, especially for Balochistan as the literacy rate still stands at 46%. Many other nations agree, but also believe that we should focus on electoral violence as it seems to be a bigger issue \n\nRussia recognizes these concerns but states how these just seem to be rumors. They aren’t willing to assume the rumours are true when there is no sort of evidence to back it up, no reports, videos or official allegations. Instead, Russia wants to go back to the root of the problem. They want to closely observe the issues and fully understand the people and problems before they start to blame anyone.   \n\nOnce they’ve gathered enough information, they want to improve the life of citizens in Balochistan. Now they’re aware this may  take time but they’re also ready to take it step by step. They heartily express that if people live in bad conditions, they are more likely to join organizations that promise them something better, this is how they get lured into terrorism. Terrorism is a huge isssue affecting this region so if they manage to stop it or at leats control it, it’ll already improve the nation by exceeding quantities. \n\nFellow governments involved in the debate, mentioned how they think it’ll be a good idea to host a conference only 2 weeks after an international aid organization is put in place. Russia strongly disagrees. They recognize how there is lots of distress between the nations and they believe how 2 weeks isn’t enough time to see how the changes put in place would play out.\n\nThe hope for change in this province is highly desired but so is the cooperation of international nations so they can save Balochistan once and for all. \n",

This transaction system will be partnered with both Paypal and Linkedin and named “Facebook Pay.” Facebook Pay will also act as a bank for people to store their money in. This will help attract more users to Facebook overall. After this, they plan on making platform integrations. They are going to add shopping and other new features to Facebook. Finally, they plan to revamp the current UI system of Facebook and start investments and research in both VR and AR. Not only this, but they plan to get more partnerships, make lifestyle changes, try to draw in younger generations, and finally increase transparency and inform the public about the data usage. \n\nUltimately, we here at the British Broadcasting Corporation would like to congratulate the members of Facebook for successfully making these decisions. \n\n\n",

  "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Anonymous Facebook Board Member Confides Evidence of Internal Threat Within Company",
  "content": "\nThe executives at Facebook currently face a dual threat. On one hand, it seems that the company is tackling some sort of data breach involving Swiss and Brazilian citizen data. Snap elections will soon occur in both nations, so this breach poses a significant problem to the integrity of these elections.\n\nHowever, the board faces a second threat: one from inside. A Fox News correspondent present at these meetings reveals that the executives currently suspect that there is a mole among them—somebody interfering with the attempted actions of the boards.\n\nA board member—who requested that we share the contents of their conversation with Fox without revealing their name—lists evidence they have seen of this collusion. They pointed out that a board member once “suggested that we shut down servers to protect data, and suddenly that ‘wasn’t feasible.’ It never went to a vote.”\n\nAnother suspicious occurrence he shared was a series of errors regarding lie detectors. “Somebody tried to get lie detectors to test staff members,” they say, “and for some reason the lie detectors ‘didn’t work.’” While attending meetings, the Fox News correspondent heard that the lie detectors did not function because they lacked batteries—a highly unusual occurrence in a multi-billion-dollar company.\n\nWhen asked if they suspected if Facebook Director Joyce Chen, Facebook Chair Tienlan Sun, or Facebook Chair Ellie Hwang were aiding the mole within the company, they state: “I don’t know. But several solutions have failed for questionable reasons.”\n\nIt is worth noting that Facebook Director Joyce Chen holds a tremendous amount of power in the company—more power than Mark Zuckerberg himself. She is also responsible for announcing all updates in the crisis, most of which are stated in a smooth, almost improvisational speech pattern, as if her very words could twist the course of the crisis.\n\nIt appears that the electoral situation in Brazil has gone downhill: candidates are pulling out left and right amidst fake news allegations. Facebook will need to take a hard stance against fake news—the same kind of news that stifled Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign—and muscle through their internal issues.\n",

  "title": "Opinion: DISEC is “Zesty” – Both Literally and Figuratively",
  "content": "(CNN) – Upon stepping into debate in DISEC, one quickly notices that the word “zest” is prominently used, both in speech and in the committee chat. From the DISEC Director stating “We appreciate your zestiness today, delegates”, Iraq responding with a “Thank you, most zesty director” and the statement being made that “UAE supports zestiness”, a question prominently appears before our minds: Is DISEC, in fact, zesty?\n\n(Opinion) – According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “zest” is a noun defined as \n“a piece of the peel of a citrus fruit (such as an orange or lemon) used as flavoring”, or alternately, “an enjoyable exciting quality” or “keen enjoyment”. The latter definitions surely seem plausible, as the delegates of Breakout Room 2 were extremely excited to the point where there were constantly three or more people loudly chattering over one another. The Director had to very loudly interrupt the delegates multiple times to restore decorum, and immediately at her departure, chaos once again ensued. The uncontrolled commotion of the lively delegates is surely the very picture of “keen enjoyment”.\n \nAs for “enjoyable exciting quality”, one need not look further than virtual backgrounds. Please proceed with caution, as some of the following descriptions may be disturbing to some viewers. From the destruction of the “cultural center” McDonalds, the mutilation of the much beloved Peppa Pig to Nicki Minaj being an icon, there are multiple depictions of “enjoyable exciting qualit[ies]”. \n \n \nNow one cannot dismiss the possibility that is a malapropism; perhaps this became an ingrained joke due to someone using the incorrect word. Perhaps an individual meant to say “hefty”, or “pesky”, or even “gillespie”, but in a moment of confusion stated “zesty”. Or this could very well be another case of glitchy audio quality hopelessly distorting words into oblivion. One can only speculate on the origins of the term.\n \nAs for the citrus fruit side of things, call to mind the phrase “fruitful debate”, and a slight connection could arguably be established. Citrus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs in the rue family, Rutaceae. Some may say debate also “flowers”, and thus, an argument can theoretically be made for even that side of things. This theory is far-fetched, but undeniably, DISEC indeed has some “zesty” qualities.  \n",

  "title": "US Senate: Curious Solutions Formed To Combat the Marginalization of Black Communities",
  "content": "In light of the political divide at the Capitol, the US Senate was in complete dismay as critical senators, including McConnell, Klobuchar, and Cruz, were all expelled from the committee, welcoming new members to power. This new era for the Senate is now met with a 50-50 Republican and Democrat divide, with all of the new senators acting as representatives of the Republican party.\n\nAs the debate resumed for the second last time, Senator Schumer recognized the perpetual economic issue faced by the Black community, denouncing the Republicans’ attempt to block all potential bills. In response, the new leader, minority Mike Carpo, wished for transportation and school choice, with empty promises of investments in these fields. \n\nFollowing this tense debate environment, the senate entered into a perpetual floor debate, with both sides introducing problems but missing accurate solutions. A key point brought up during the discussion from the Republicans was an educational tax credit for minority families, echoing the sounds of choice for education. Furthermore, discussion of down payment advancement saw tremendous support from left and right in the senate as they agreed that affordable housing is critical for advancements. \n\nSenator Bernie Sanders presented an incredible argument in the housing markets issue of systemic racism, quoting a study that showcased homes owned by white families in the same neighbourhood are worth more by as much as thirty percent. \n\nEnding the debate, minority leader Carpo pushed the need for a greater transportation infrastructure outlining the detriment caused by previous issues. The centuries-long battle that is national American politics fervently continues.\n",

  "title": "Opinion: The Nordic Solution, and the West’s Struggle To Preserve Linguistic Minorities",
  "content": "Founded on colonisation and persecution, many western nations have adopted their own language(s) as the official one(s), disregarding those of oppressed, Indigenous groups. Apart from imperialism, the lack of Indigenous literature has led to this decline in its usage and function. Some nations in SOCHUM have proposed government education programs to teach minority languages at schools, whilst others have called for the use of technological databases to store these languages. \n\nHowever, there are two prime issues with these proposals. Firstly, not all non-minority-language speaking residences might be particularly keen on learning another language. Many nations like Canada already have numerous official languages, and an increasing number of people feel no need to learn more than one. Secondly, even if these minority languages are stored, it would serve no practical function in the long run as the number of speakers won’t necessarily increase nationally.\n\nTo combat this, nations, particularly Finland, have proposed enforcing laws regarding the persecution of linguistic minorities and special rights for its speakers. It is crucial for minority language speakers to better their socio-economic statuses to be in the position of influence to spread their respective language(s). Affirmative action to a mild extent would aid in this process. Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that the overuse of such initiatives would result in decreased quality of work. \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/2vDLRTH\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/hBPnrSw/Official-languages-Finland-2015.png\" alt=\"Official-languages-Finland-2015\" border=\"0\">\n\nChina has 56 ethnic groups, many of which have their own languages and dialects. It has done particularly well in preserving them through a combination of teaching Mandarin, English, and an ethnic group’s own language. Hence, individuals from marginalised groups would master widespread languages, offering them numerous job opportunities, whilst still preserving their own beautiful languages. \n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/PZr6nnD\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/XZWCggY/China-linguistic-map.jpg\" alt=\"China-linguistic-map\" border=\"0\">",

  "title": "Fictional Crisis Committee: Count Rupert Mountjoy Attempts Diplomacy, Offends with Speech using Baguette",
  "content": "(CNN) – In a truly remarkable demonstration of diplomacy, on behalf of the Duchy of Grand Fenwick Count Rupert Mountjoy attempted to gain the support of the French during a tumultuous period of time. He valiantly proclaimed his adoration towards the French people, and in an attempt to show his support, procured a baguette and held it out as a conductor would their baton, and unconventionally took a bite as a salute to the French.\n However, this would prove to be a detrimental mistake. Laura Backstab pointed out that a “baguette [was] used to kill the late duchess”, this reminder causing an outcry of rage as the French were reminded of the tragic murder of the late Duchess, met a floury assassination via fatal head wound from a baguette very much like the one being held in that controversial speech by Count Mountjoy.\nThe same Count later showcases his support for disputable categories of weaponry, asking \nwhat difference [exists] between “a chemical” or a “nuclear weapon”, and proclaims “people die in war” and “we must accept that”. Count Mountjoy is certainly turning many heads with his controversial speeches.\nCount Rupert Mountjoy has been deposed of as of 12:33 PM PST.\n",
